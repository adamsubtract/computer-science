Short Answer

Why do programmers use pseudocode?

A: They use it to build programs andIt helps programmers organize their thoughts/ideas for programs.

If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?

A: Nothing, its for humans to read.





Programming Assignment

1. Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

    FUNCTION myFunction(accepts two numbers)
        IF number 1 is greater that number 2
          DISPLAY number 1
        ELSE
          DISPLAY number 2
        ENDIF
    ENDFUNCTION

2. Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

    FUNCTION prints 1 through 100
        FOR number is less than or equal to 100
          DISPLAY number
        ENDFOR
    ENDFUNCTION

3. Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

    FUNCTION compares a string to a array of strings
        FOR i is less then array length
            IF string is equal to array string
              DISPLAY found string
            ENDIF
        ENDFOR
    ENDFUNCTION

4. Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in
   any computer language of your choice.

   const phoneBook = [
 {
   name: 'Adam',
   phone: 619123456
 },
 {
   name: 'Jon',
   phone: 619133456
 },
 {
   name: 'Mike',
   phone: 619123456
 }

];

var firstName = 'Adam';

var find = function(string, array) {
  for(i = 0; i < array.length; i++){
    if(string == array[i].name){
      console.log("found " + string)
    }
  }
};

find(firstName, phoneBook);
